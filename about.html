        <h2>Project Background</h2>
        <p>This project was made with the aim of merging technology and music education to create an interactive web platform focused on providing a user-friendly environment for 
          <br>elementary and middle school children, with the intention of challenging their minds to engage with randomized beats per minute (BPM) in order to refine their rhythmic 
          <br>perceptions. This aligns with the understanding that music and rhythm play crucial roles in cognitive development, aiding in the enhancement of memory, attention, and 
          <br>pattern recognition. By incorporating an element of randomness in the BPM, the game not only provides an enjoyable experience but also challenges the users to actively 
          <br>listen, discern patterns, and make guesses, which promotes critical thinking skills in a fun and interactive way. The game format was chosen because we believe that a 
          <br>gamified learning experience can be a valuable supplement to tradicional music education methods, making it more engaging for the younger audience. By combining gaming 
          <br>with education, we aim to spark an interest in music and rhythm, inspiring and encouraging further learning that can potentially impact the appreciation for the arts 
          <br>among the participating kids 
        </p>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>To start to enjoy our interactive music game the user will create an account with a username and password so they are able to log in to the game and be able to save their 
          <br>progress. After they log in the user will be directed to the main screen and have the options to choose a game difficulty and then start a game , check out the 
          <br>leaderboard that contains other users and their associated scores in their game session as well as view their profile and make any edits if needed such as changing 
          <br>their username and password. When the user wants to start a game they can pick a difficulty such as easy, medium and hard mode and five questions will be asked in each 
          <br>mode. In easy mode the user is given a sound clip and they need to guess the BPM of the played sound clip. During this mode hints are given to help guide the user to the 
          <br>right answer if they are struggling. In medium and hard mode no hints are offered and the user will need to use the experience they received from the easy mode to guess 
          <br>the BPM of the sound clip. After the game is played they are sent to another screen that shows the results of that game and on this screen feedback is given to them 
          <br>about their initial round. Information on this results screen consists of their final score that will be the users average in guessing the right answers as a percentage.
          <br>This results screen will render the user to choose an option such as return to the main screen, share their results with friends and view the leaderboard or view their 
          <br>profile as well as be able to invite friends to play a game with them. When the user returns to the main screen, their initial game played will be saved and they can see 
          <br>their results at any time and be able to activate any of the options mentioned above as well as be able to track their progress over time if they have played multiple 
          <br>games already.
        </p>

        <h2>Domain Research</h2>
        <p>
        In our exploration of BPM (Beats Per Minute) for an educational context, we utilized a few resources to enhance our understanding of musical timing and rhythm.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        To further refine our understanding of BPM in music, we delved into the <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.doe.mass.edu%2Fframeworks%2Farts%2F2019-08.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank">Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education's Arts Curriculum Framework</a> (2019, August). Although not directly related to musical BPM, this resource offered insights into arts education and how MA handled musical education.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        Additionally, we explored the <a href="https://college.berklee.edu/core-music-curriculum" target="_blank">Core Music Curriculum</a> provided by Berklee College of Music. This resource offered valuable insights into structuring music education programs, which helped us focus on what aspects were important for reinforcement learning.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        Armed with insights from these diverse sources, our goal is to incorporate BPM concepts, specifically in the musical sense, into an educational BPM guessing game. This approach aims to engage students in understanding musical tempo and rhythm in an interactive and entertaining manner.
